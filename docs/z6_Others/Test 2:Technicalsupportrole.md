## Question 1:
Hello! I have the neon sign customizer app installed on my Shopify store but every time a customer creates a custom sign the app automatically creates a product on my store which is automatically published on my social media and it's becoming a problem, I want to know if there is a way for the customizer to work without the option of creating the product on my inventory.

Hey Matthew,


Thanks for reaching out. 

I understand how frustrating it must be to have automatic product creation issues in your shop. I'm sorry for any hassle this has caused you.

Don't worry, though. There's a simple fix for this! I'd recommend checking out this article: <a href="https://sign-customizer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/20-hide-custom-neon-products"  style={{ color: '#64BBFF', textDecoration: 'none' }}> Hide custom neon products displaying on your storefront.</a> It should guide you through the process of preventing auto generated products from showing up in your store.

And if you need anything else or have any other questions, just let me know. My team and I are always here to help and support you.

Thank you


Farah

In order to effectively address customer attrition, it is important that we first understand the factors that led to the customer's decision to discontinue our services, and that's why I requested some information in questions 3 and 5 before I took any further action.
