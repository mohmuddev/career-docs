# Python fundamentals

## Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

```python title="Variable names and assignment statments"
name = "mohamud ali farah"
n  = 17
pi = 3.141592653589793

```

```python title="Python 3 keywords that can not be use as variable"
False        finally   is         return  class 
None         for       lambda     try     continue
True         from      nonlocal   while   def 
and          global    not        with    del  
as elif      if        or         yield
assert       else      import     pass
break        except    in         raise

```

## Expressions and statements

An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators while statment is is a unit of code that has an effect, like creating a variable or displaying a
value.
```python title="Expression examples"
42
n  = 17
n + 25 = 42

```

```python title="Statement examples"
n  = 17
print(n)

```
